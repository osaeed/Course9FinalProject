		<h4>Author: Omer Saeed<br>Date: 3/8/2020</h4>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		The Central Limit Theorem states that when independent normal variables are added, their sum tends towards a normal distribution, even if the original distribution is not normal.  <br><br>We will build a Shiny app to show how this applies to the means of an exponential distribution.  According to the Central Limit Theorem, sample mean should follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, which is 1 / Lambda for this distribution.<br>
		This Shiny app allows users to simulate the distribution of the means of the exponential distribution.
		<h2> Usage</h2>
		The user will specify 3 parameters using the sliders in the side panel<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Lambda - The parameter for the exponential distribution.</li>
			<li>Number of Samples - How many samples will be generated.</li>
			<li>Sample Size - The number of exponential observations in each sample.</li>
		</ul>
		After clicking "Submit", the simulation will run with the specified parameters, and a histogram of the sample means will be displayed.  You will also see the Population Mean (1 / lambda) and Simulation Mean (mean of each of the Sample Means) displayed under the Submit button.<br>
